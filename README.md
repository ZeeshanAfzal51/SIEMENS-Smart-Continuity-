# SIEMENS-Smart-Continuity-
Developed a microcontroller-based continuity tester using pull-up and pull-down resistances to upload terminal test results to a database, viewable via a mobile app by technicians and remote engineers. Also proposed AR headgear for next-gen continuity testers to enhance efficiency.
